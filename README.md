# Node.js Project Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

Before installing the npm packages and running the index script, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

## Installing npm Packages

To install the npm packages required by this project, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
npm install
```
After running the above command, all the necessary dependencies will be installed in the `node_modules` directory of your project.

## Running the Index Script

Once the npm packages are installed, you can run the index script by executing the following command in your terminal:

This will execute the `index.js` file located in the root directory of your project. The output of this script will be displayed in the terminal.
